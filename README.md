# Snack-Attack
A short RenPy visual novel wherein a paladin goes on an epic quest (aka a snack run).

I created this game within three weeks in December 2019 as a gift for a friend.
It was based on a rather silly session of Dungeons and Dragons.

For the full credits, see the game's About section from the main menu.

The game is available for PC and Mac, but as the zip for the Mac was too large to upload to GitHub, I have elected not to include it for now.
Email mgpiehl@gmail.com if you would like the Mac zip.

Thanks for reading! Hope you enjoy the game!
